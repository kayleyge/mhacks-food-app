add the necessary UI components that are typically used in a Next.js project with shadcn/ui. These components will be created in separate files within the components/ui directory.

Let's create the following components:

Button
Card (including CardContent, CardDescription, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle)
Input
Label
Tabs (including TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger)
Dialog (including DialogContent, DialogDescription, DialogFooter, DialogHeader, DialogTitle, DialogTrigger)
Here are the component files:







These components are now ready to be used in your FridgeFresh app. They are styled using Tailwind CSS and follow the shadcn/ui design system.

To use these components, you'll need to make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

@radix-ui/react-dialog
@radix-ui/react-label
@radix-ui/react-slot
@radix-ui/react-tabs
class-variance-authority
lucide-react
You can install these dependencies by running:

npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-label @radix-ui/react-slot @radix-ui/react-tabs class-variance-authority lucide-react

npm install @radix-ui/react-dialog @radix-ui/react-label @radix-ui/react-slot @radix-ui/react-tabs class-variance-authority lucide-react
Also, make sure you have a utils.ts file in your lib directory with the cn function:


This setup will allow you to use these components throughout your FridgeFresh app, providing a consistent and accessible user interface.
